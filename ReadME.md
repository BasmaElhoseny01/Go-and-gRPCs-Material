This repository contains my learning projects, notes, and experiments related to gRPC and GoLang. It is organized into different sections to help you navigate through my learning journey and includes resources, examples, and coding materials.

## üñãÔ∏è Repository Structure
### 1. **My Learning Projects**
This section contains the projects and code I created while learning:

- **`MyProjects/Go_hello_world/`**
  -A simple Go project to demonstrate basic socket programming concepts and GoLang fundamentals.
- **`MyProjects/Grpc/`**
  - Contains a gRPC example project using `addressbook.proto`.
- **`MyProjects/hello_world/`**
  - Includes a basic gRPC Hello World example with `client`, `server`, and `proto` directories.
- **`MyProjects/Protobufs/`**
  - Demonstrates how to work with protocol buffers (protobuf) in Python, including compiled `.proto` files.

### 2. **Tutorial Resources**
This section contains resources and code provided during the tutorial:

- **`Tutorial/src/`**
Contains example code provided by the teaching assistant (TA). Examples include:
  - gRPC Implementation
  - TCP and UDP Implementations
- **`Tutorial/Go Sockets & RPCs.pdf`**
